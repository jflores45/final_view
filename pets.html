            <p>Luna is a German shepherd mix and a fireball of energy. Oftentimes, destroying anything in her path she will take and hide all your socks, shoes, and clothes for her to chew on. She loves playing catch at the park, it always gives her the zoomies. </p>
            <p>Luna is a very jealous, loving, and protective dog. She really embraces her inner chihuahua and will bark at any stranger, car, or noise at night. She makes the perfect guard dog. But she is not at all aggressive. Luna is all bark no bite!</p>

            <p>Finn is a 7 year old grey cat. I feel like no one really knows cat breeds so I’m just gonna go with grey. He loves doing tricks for treats and his favorite is giving high fives to people. He might as well be a dog as he loves the outdoors and meeting new people. I can only describe him as goofy and chaotic. </p>
            <p>Finn’s biggest enemy is his vet. I don't know whether or not it’s because his vet is an MSU alum, but he doesn’t like him. He actually has to be prescribed a sedative before he goes to the vet office because he’ll suddenly act like he was never a house cat for 7 years.</p>

            <p>Carlos is a blue parakeet/budgerigar that my older sister adopted from her friend in high school. 
                Carlos is 9 years old and loves flying around the kitchen and standing on chandeliers.
                She has very loud chirps and loves to chatter when people play instruments. Although she can be 
                aggressive at times and is very unfriendly towards strangers, she has a very soft bite.
            </p>
            <p>Carlos has a sister named Einstein. We did not discover the genders of our pet birds until years 
                after we named them. At night, Carlos always sleeps on her favorite yellow swing and will wake up
                 in the same spot every morning in the upstairs of her cage ready to come out and play.</p>

            <p>Milktea is a Scottish fold with a personality of a princess. She loves her veggies and refuses to eat anything dropped on the ground. She makes it clear when she has a demand of any sort by complaining in a loud, distinguished manner. If what she says could be translated, it probably would be, “This is atrocious, the water container has been empty for the 3rd time this week. I want to see the manager.”.</p>
            <p>Despite her cuteness and royalty, she actually suffers from a genetic disorder intentionally brought upon by humans. I highly advise against keeping a Scottish fold because they are in constant pain when they reach around 2 years old. Cartilage accumulates around her paw joints and tail joints and it becomes painful for them to even walk. She is living evidence of human’s cruelty of breeding animals to look pretty while sacrificing the animals’ health.  </p>

            <p>Honeys favorite thing in the world is swimming. Even if it is the middle of January and half of the lake is frozen, Honey will be in the water. She is a smart swimmer, so when my brother and I go underwater, she will follow our air bubbles and be waiting for us when we come up for air.</p>
            <p>While most dogs like to chase balls or sticks, Honey likes to chase rocks. She will even chase rocks into the water and stick her whole face in the water to try and find the rock thrown. Chasing rocks is her main form of exercise right now as she refuses to go on walks from our house. If we drive her to another spot and walk from there, Honey will go on a walk but she refuses to leave our driveway when we try to walk from home. Finally one other Honey-ism is that her safe place is bathtubs. Many times our family has woken up in the middle of the night and found Honey is a bathtub</p>
